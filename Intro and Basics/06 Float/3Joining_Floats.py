#There are two ways we can join floats, with the value itself or through variables! 

#Lets just add values together! 

print(5.2)
print(16.16)


#You can also print integer sums.

print(5.0-3.2)
print(4.0*10.0)
print(19.50+43.5)

#Lets make variables = integers.

five = 5.5
print(five)

random_variable = 20.2
print(random_variable)


#Lets add two variables together 

two = 2.0
three = 3.0

print(two + three)

#You can use the same variable but with different arithmetic symbols

print(two * three)
