#Here are some examples! All of these statements will print when ran in the terminal. 
#If you want to run just one at a time, add a # in front of the ones you want hidden. Give it a go to test your commenting knowledge skills! 

print("I am printing this line of text into the terminal using double quotation marks")

print('I can also print this line using single quotation marks')

print(1) #Numbers do not need "" or ''

print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) #The commas will not be printed, it is helping to seperate these values rather than printing 12345.

print(10 + 5) #You can use this as a calculator to print the answer! You can use + - * / and % (% shows remainder).
