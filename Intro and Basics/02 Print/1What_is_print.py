#Print means that you are asking Python to write in the terminal what you want seen. 

#You need to be explicit with this and tell it exactly what you want printed using the correct format/syntax. 

#This is what the function looks like (minus the hashtag). Within the parentheses, you can write a number, call a variable or print a string of characters.
#print("Insert your text here")

#Printing text - make sure to use either "" or '' within the parentheses. Whatever is within the quotation marks will be printed into the terminal when ran.
