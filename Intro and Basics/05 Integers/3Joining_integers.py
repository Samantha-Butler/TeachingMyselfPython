#There are two ways we can join integers, with the value itself or through variables! 

#Lets just add values together! 

print(5)
print(16)


#You can also print integer sums.

print(5-3)
print(4*10)
print(19+43)

#Lets make variables = integers.

five = 5
print(five)

random_variable = 20
print(random_variable)


#Lets add two variables together 

two = 2
three = 3

print(two + three)

#You can use the same variable but with different arithmetic symbols

print(two * three)
