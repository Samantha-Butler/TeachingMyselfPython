#Here are examples of strings within variables. To see them, always print! Otherwise the computer stores that knowledge within itself.

string = "This is a string because it is text written in quotation marks"
string2  = 'Strings are also used with single quotation marks'

print(string)
print(string2)

#You dont need a variable, strings can be printed directly into the print function.

print("I can print whatever text within this string.")
