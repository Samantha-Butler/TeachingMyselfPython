#You can add two variables of strings together to print into one line. 
#Just know that only strings can join with strings and you cannot just add any other datatype with a string variable. 
#(In advanced, we can show a way around this but lets start basic! 


first_string = "I like bananas and "         #Note that I have left a space at the end of this string before closing it off. This is so theres a space before the next printed word.
second_string = "watermelons for snack time."

print(first_string + second_string)



#Sometimes the variables aren't in order - so you just print the order you'd like! See below for an examples

first = "Once upon a time "
second =  "and a crazy old bakers wife. "
third = "there lived a crazy old baker, "
fourth = "Gingerbread Fred said 'Run run run, as fast as you can, you can't catch me I'm the gingerbreadman!'"
fifth = "One day they made a gingerbread man, who suddenly came to life!"

print(first + third + second + fifth + fourth)
