#Here we will assign variables and some values. Remember if you want to see them in the terminal, we must print them! 

favourite_colour = "Yellow"
favourite_number = 8
current_year = 2023

#Let's print them! We use the variable name to get the value printed in the terminal. 

print(favourite_colour)
print(favourite_number)
print(current_year)


#We can use arithmetic sums within variables to get a result in the terminal! 

adding_numbers = 4+5
multiply_numbers = 5*32
divide_numbers = 20/2
bodmas_example = 3+7*14

#Let's print these sums! Notice that the terminal replies with the answer and not the whole number sentence.

print(adding_numbers)
print(multiply_numbers)
print(divide_numbers)
