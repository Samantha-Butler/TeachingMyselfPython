#Variables is a term you will hear a lot and one that takes a bit of practise before you can fully understand it. The best way is to see it in action and use it. 

#Your computer will store information, this information can be numbers, values or lines of text (strings). In order to store this information, it is placed under a variable
#The computer will then remember the key word/variable and what you assigned as its value. 

#For example the work on the left is the variable, the one on the right is the value. 

name = "Samantha"

#In the example above, the variable is called 'name' and whenever we call this variable, the computer will remember that it will = "Samantha"

age = 29

#In the example on line 12, the variable 'age' will now always be assigned the number 29. Lets print it and see what happens!

print(name)
print(age)

#We have asked the computer to print out the values of our variables 'name' and 'age.' Just like numbers, when we print them, we won't need any quotation marks.



#Important things to remember: 
#   1. When creating the variable name, keep it simple, don't use silly names that will be seen by other developers.
#   2. Don't use spaces inbetween your variable name, use an underscore to seperate text: this_is_a_variable   ->   this is not
